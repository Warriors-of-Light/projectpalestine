## Project Palestine

What is project palestine? Watch a video explanation here.

---

Project Palesine is an open source project to support the Palestinan people, restore our voices and show the world that even though governments could be inhumane, we the people hold the real power to shape humanity.

Project Palestine is/will be a hub for many tools and applications to support the Palestinian cause and aid their humanitarian crisis. Right now it only has one application to assist humans who don't support the occupation in making more informed purchases from brands and companies that don't support the occupation. Here is how it works:

- You go to the store or browse online, about to buy something
- You check Project Palestine database to see if the product or company is listed
- If it's listed, you don't buy the product, go to the store or acquire the service
- If it's not listed, you are good to go

## Stage 1 : Web app

This is the current website hosted [here](https://projectpalestine.org). The website hosts a database that is community-sourced, this means you as an individual can make a difference by researching and validating information and adding them to the database.

## Stage 2 (need volunteers): Mobile app

Soon you will be able to scan a bar code and get results on the fly with a mobile app. If you are an experienced React Native developer and want to assist, please join our discord server [here](https://discord.gg/D5yZGRVZ).

## Stage 3 (need volunteers): Browser Extension

A browser extension that gets activated when you are about to make a purchase online, highlighting if the product supports the occupation or not. It also will ask you to round up on every online purchase to a support Gaza and the Palestinian people.
